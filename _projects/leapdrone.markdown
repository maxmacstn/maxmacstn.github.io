This project aims to supply an intuitive control scheme toward the end-user who wishes to control a drone but are intimidate by the complex controls. To achieve this, the project based the controls of a drone on the orientation of a human hand. This is very essential to the project as despite the hand being the input of the project it is the arm that control the hand orientation. This open the project up for use by those with special needs so long as they did not lost control of their entire arm.

This project was part of the Human-Computer Interaction class project in Software Engineer (international program), Faculty of Engineering, KMITL.
